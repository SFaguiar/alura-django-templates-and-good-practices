# Django: templates e boas pr√°ticas
## What is this repository?
This repository is the result of a Django course by Alura, which can be found in https://cursos.alura.com.br/course/django-templates-boas-praticas. I only typed the same code, did the exercices and made a few changes.
The objetive of the course is to understand what is the framework Django, what can I do with templates and how to configure a project and its apps. Other Django courses in Alura will teach you (and me) how to use other Django funcionalities, like the admin mode, forms authentication etc.
